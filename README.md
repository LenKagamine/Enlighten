# Enlighten

Check it out at https://enlighten-game.herokuapp.com/

Enlighten is a collaborative webgame. You are a little square, navigating a dark maze with only a small torch.

Use WASD or Arrow keys to move around the maze. If you collide with the walls of the maze, you leave a small light showing where you died, and return to the start of the maze. Find the way out by learning from your and others' mistakes.

To help, there are campfires: permanent light sources scattered across the maze. Walk over them to refuel your decaying torch. You can see other players' lights, and they can see yours too. The more players online, the easier it is to complete a level.
